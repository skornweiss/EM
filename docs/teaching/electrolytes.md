# Hyponatremia
## Resources
[EM Cases](https://emergencymedicinecases.com/episode-60-emergency-management-hyponatremia/)
[MD Calc](https://www.mdcalc.com/sodium-correction-rate-hyponatremia-hypernatremia)

## Signs/symptoms
- muscular weakness
- headache
- lethargy
- confusion
- unsteady gait
- seizures, coma
  
## Causes
- Lab/measurement problem - (pseudohypnoatremia) - lipemia (shouldn't happen with modern labs)
- Water shifts from cells to serum (osmotic pressure) - hyperglycemia
- Can't pee out water - heart/liver/renal failure, endocrine (SIADH, hypothyroid)
- Drinking too much water - exercise induced, psychogenic polydypsia
- Peeing out too much salt - adrenal insufficiency, diuretic use, cerebral salt wasting
- Drinking too much water and not enough salt/protein - beer potomania, "tea and toast"

## Treatment

### Mild/asymptomatic and onset greater than 48 hours
- if hypovolemic - give fluids - 3%, LR, NS, use MDCalc to calculate rate based on fluid choice
- if hypervolemic - take away fluids - furosemide
- if hyper or euvolemic - restrict free water, give salt, fix pathology
- if hypo-osmotic - give osmoles - food, salt
- if hyper-osmotic - move unwanted osmoles (hyperglycemia --> insulin)
- if endocrine problem - may need to add/remove/block hormones - corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, ddAVP
- if at risk of over-correction from spontaneous water diuresis - consider dDAVP(desmopressin)

### Severe symptoms (seizing, coma) and onset of hyponatremia within 48 hrs
  - raise by 1-5mmol/L/hr until symptoms resolve or Na+ 125-130mmol/L
  - hypertonic saline (3%) 1-2ml/kg/hr
  - use MDCalc to find correction rate for diff. fluids

## Disposition
- Discharge: chronic AND sodium > 120 meq/l AND asymptomatic
  - this is from uptodate, I personally start to get nervous around 125 depending on chronicity
- Admit: acute OR sodium < 120 meq/l OR symptomatic
