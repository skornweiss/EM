# Hyponatremia
## Resources
[EM Cases](https://emergencymedicinecases.com/episode-60-emergency-management-hyponatremia/)
[MD Calc](https://www.mdcalc.com/sodium-correction-rate-hyponatremia-hypernatremia)

## Signs/symptoms
- muscular weakness
- headache
- lethargy
- confusion
- unsteady gait
- seizures, coma
  
## Causes
- Spurious - (pseudohypnoatremia) - lipemia (shouldn't happen with modern labs)
- Water shifts from cells to serum (osmotic pressure) - hyperglycemia
- Can't pee out water - heart/liver/renal failure, endocrine (SIADH, hypothyroid)
- Drinking too much water - exercise induced, psychogenic polydypsia
- Peeing out too much salt - adrenal insufficiency, diuretic use, cerebral salt wasting
- Drinking too much water and not enough salt/protein - beer potomania, "tea and toast"

## Treatment

### Mild/asymptomatic and onset greater than 48 hours
- if hypovolemic - give fluids - 3%, LR, NS, use MDCalc to calculate rate based on fluid choice
- if hypervolemic - take away fluids - furosemide
- if hyper or euvolemic - restrict free water, give salt, fix pathology
- if hypo-osmotic - give osmoles - food, salt
- if hyper-osmotic - move unwanted osmoles (hyperglycemia --> insulin)
- if endocrine problem - may need to add/remove/block hormones - corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, ddAVP
- if at risk of over-correction from spontaneous water diuresis - consider dDAVP(desmopressin)

### Severe symptoms (seizing, coma) and onset of hyponatremia within 48 hrs
  - raise by 1-5mmol/L/hr until symptoms resolve or Na+ 125-130mmol/L
  - hypertonic saline (3%) 1-2ml/kg/hr
  - use MDCalc to find correction rate for diff. fluids

## Disposition
- Discharge: chronic AND sodium > 120 meq/l AND asymptomatic
  - this is from uptodate, I personally start to get nervous around 125 depending on chronicity
- Admit: acute OR sodium < 120 meq/l OR symptomatic

# Hyperkalemia

## Resources
[LITFL Review - ECG Examples](https://litfl.com/hyperkalaemia-ecg-library/)

## Signs/symptoms
- muscle weakness, ascending
- palpitations
- fatigue
- weakness
  
## Causes
- Spurious - long tourniquet time, hemolysis
- Moves out of cells - rhabdo, DKA (other acidosis), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis
- Taking too much - supplements
- Can't pee it out - renal failure, ace-inhibitor +/- [trimethoprim](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8328738), K+ sparing diuretics, adrenal insufficiency
  
## Treatments
- Mild - asymptomatic, no ECG changes, usually K+ < 6.0
  - treat underlying cause
  - e.g. - remove supplement/offending medication, hydration

- Severe - symptomatic, ECG changes, K+ > 6.0
  - Stabilize - Calcium Gluconate 1 gram IV
  - Dilute - IVF
  - Shift - insulin, D50, albuterol, bicarbonate
  - Remove - diuretics, dialysis, kayexelate (SPS - sodium polystyrene sulfonate), lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate)
  
## Disposition
- Discharge: <6 AND asymptomatic AND no ECG changes AND underlying cause is known AND problem is fixed
- Admit: >= 6 or ECG changes or underlying cause not known/not fixed
  
## ECG Findings
- Peaked T waves - symmetric, pointy, sometimes tall
- Prolonged intervals - everything gets spaced out, QRS is widened, QT prolonged, T wave broad based
- Junctional Bradycardia - no P waves, Rate 40-60. QRS and T look like mirror images
- Vfib/Vtach
- Sine Wave



# Hypokalemia

## Resources
[LITFL HypoK](https://litfl.com/hypokalaemia/)
[Stephen Smith ECG Blog](https://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2019/05/potassium-and-magnesium-how-low-is-too.html)

## Signs/symptoms
- myalgias
- cramping, spasms
- weakness
- paralysis
  
## Causes
- Not taking enough - malnutrition
- Shifting - unusual (alkalosis, hyperinsulinemia, b-agonist), hypokalemic periodic paralysis
- Peeing out too much - diuretics (new thiazide), hypomagnesemia, hyperaldosteronism (cushing's)
- Pooping/Vomiting it out - diarrhea, vomiting
  
## Treatments
- Repletion - oral solution, pills, IV
- 10 meq either oral or IV will increase serum concentration by 0.1 meq/l
  - i.e. if serum level is 3.0 meq/l, giving 10 meq will increase serum concentration to 3.1 meq/l
- Also check and replete magnesium if needed
- Stop potassium wasting drugs (diuretics)

## Disposition
- Discharge: if asymptomatic AND K+ > 2.5 AND no ECG changes AND able to replete at home
- Admit: if symptomatic OR K+ < 2.5 OR ECG changes OR not able to replete at home
  
## ECG Findings
- U waves
- T wave flattening
- Down-up T wave morphology
- ST depression
- Long QT
- Torsades
